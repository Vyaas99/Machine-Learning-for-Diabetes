# Data Analysis and Modelling to determine predictors of acute diabetic events that require hospital admission and to predict readmission rates

This was part of the final project of CIS-5450.
We performed EDA on the dataset and had to do a lot of data cleaning.
We ran logistic regression models, decision trees and random forests.
